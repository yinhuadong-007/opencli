## Positioning

This adapter reuses the existing OpenCLI Browser Bridge runtime:

- no custom NotebookLM extension
- no exported cookie replay
- requests and page state stay in the real Chrome session

The current milestone focuses on a stable NotebookLM read surface in desktop Chrome with an already logged-in Google account.

## Usage Examples

```bash
opencli notebooklm status
opencli notebooklm list -f json
opencli notebooklm open nb-demo -f json
opencli notebooklm current -f json
opencli notebooklm get -f json
opencli notebooklm source-list -f json
opencli notebooklm source-get "Quarterly report" -f json
opencli notebooklm source-guide "Quarterly report" -f json
opencli notebooklm source-fulltext "Quarterly report" -f json
opencli notebooklm history -f json
opencli notebooklm note-list -f json
opencli notebooklm notes-get "Draft note" -f json
opencli notebooklm summary -f json
```

## Prerequisites

- Chrome running and logged into Google / NotebookLM
- [Browser Bridge extension](/guide/browser-bridge) installed
- NotebookLM accessible in the current browser session

## Notes

- Notebook-oriented commands run in OpenCLI's owned NotebookLM adapter session/window. Use `opencli notebooklm open <notebook>` first to choose the current notebook for follow-up commands.
- `list`, `get`, `source-list`, `history`, `source-fulltext`, and `source-guide` prefer NotebookLM RPC paths and fall back only when the richer path is unavailable.
- `notes-get` currently reads note content only from the visible Studio note editor; if the note is listed but not open, open it in NotebookLM first and then retry.
